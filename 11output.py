#python print(  ) function is often used to output
#variables

x = "python is pretty good"
print(x)

# in the print() function, you output multiple variables, 
# separated by a comma:

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "pretty good"
print(x,y,z)

# you can also use the + operator to output multiple
# variables:

t = "python"
u = "is"
g = "awesome"

print(t+u+g)

# in the print( ) function,
# when you try to combine a string and a number with 
# the + operator, python will give error:

# x = 5
# y = "Eddyx"
# print(x+y)

# instead + try comma,

x = 5
y = "Eddyx"
print(x,y)
